## Motivation
This whole project was made to demonstrate my backend skills by implementing my own server logic without the use of libraries nor frameworks. Even though this approach makes things more difficult, it helps myself on learning new things and a new language. By building small prototypes of applications like so, we can explore the limits of the project and decide to continue it or not.

## Packages Used

- net/http
- html/template
